# Final-Project
Project Description: The Final Project is a simple and functional website that should consist of at least...
1) a Home, About, and Contact page with working links 
2) a consistent color scheme throughout the site 
3) a hero image
4) a header with a logo and navigation bar 
5) a footer with social media icon links
6) a contact form 
7) Google Map Embed
8) video and/or audio embed
9) at least one image that is a link 
10) and locally downloaded dependencies

It also utilizes HTML and CSS coding to showcase what I have learned in the Websites for Beginners class. Some of the challenges that I have faced are understading when or how to use <div> tags, mixing tags, and aligning content next to each other. Sometimes, I can get confused by why the footer is not working or why the background color won't cover the entire page like it's supposed to. I hope to implement better practices in the future.
