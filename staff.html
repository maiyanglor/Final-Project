                <h2>Gaoyong Yang-Vang</h2>
                <h3>President</h3>
              <p>Gaoyong Yang-Vang, primarily known as Gao, was born in Fresno, CA, but has been raised all around the Central 
                Valley. She is in her first year in Fresno State's MFA program. She studies poetry and writes about the instability 
                of her childhood and attempts to understand her own past without familial roots and exploring non-traditional 
                identities of a Hmong woman. On her writing, friend and mentor Anthony Cody, says Gao “explores Hmongness in fresh, 
                unexpected ways that ask readers to think beyond the roles and tropes often depicted in popular culture of Hmong.”</p>

                <h2>Tony Vang</h2>
                <h3>Vice President</h3>
                <p>Tony Vang was born and raised in Fresno, and he is quick to always proudly claim that he is from Southeast Fresno. 
                He originally had no interest in writing, or college for that matter, but after taking a poetry writing class, he 
                discovered that he enjoyed writing more than anything else college had to offer. As a result, he remained in the 
                writing community for a handful of years, practicing and reading poetry until this very day. Tony mostly writes 
                love poems, having discovered his affinity for the genre after reading Pablo Neruda’s “Love Sonnet XVII”.</p>

                <h3>Treasurer</h3>
                <p>Lee Lee was born and raised in Fresno, California. She is a second-year fiction student in Fresno State's 
                MFA Program in Creative Writing. Her current works seek to understand the real and imagined inner worlds of 
                being a Hmong woman, gender roles and flying chickens included. She spends too many late nights reading 
                manhwas, listening to sad love songs, and drawing K-pop fanart.</p>

                <h2>Laura Thor</h2>
                <h3>Secretary</h3>
                <p>Laura Thor was born in Stockton and raised in Fresno, CA. She is in her last year of her undergraduate studies for English with the focus of creative writing. Reading has always been her source of 
                inspiration and escape whenever the world around her felt tense and hopeless. As she got older, her interest towards writing sparked from personal narratives that inspired her to understand her 
                identity as a Hmong American. This caused her to change her major from pre-nursing to English, which was her first step towards pursuing what she genuinely wanted to do. Her current goal as a young 
                writer and scholar is to further expose herself to Asian American literature in order to learn more about the patterns of cultural migration.</p>

                State graduate with a BA degree in English Education and a minor in Art (Graphic Design). During her leisure time, Mai is either spoiling her cats, writing fictional stories, or playing PC games 
                with her fiancé.</p>
