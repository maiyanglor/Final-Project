                <h2>Gaoyong Yang-Vang</h2>
                <h3>HAIS Club President</h3>
              <p>Gaoyong Yang-Vang, primarily known as Gao, was born in Fresno, CA, but has been raised all around the Central 
                Valley. She is in her first year in Fresno State's MFA program. She studies poetry and writes about the instability 
                of her childhood and attempts to understand her own past without familial roots and exploring non-traditional 
                identities of a Hmong woman. On her writing, friend and mentor Anthony Cody, says Gao “explores Hmongness in fresh, 
                unexpected ways that ask readers to think beyond the roles and tropes often depicted in popular culture of Hmong.”</p>

                <h2>Tony Vang</h2>
                <h3>HAIS Club Vice President</h3>
                <p>Tony Vang was born and raised in Fresno, and he is quick to always proudly claim that he is from Southeast Fresno. 
                He originally had no interest in writing, or college for that matter, but after taking a poetry writing class, he 
                discovered that he enjoyed writing more than anything else college had to offer. As a result, he remained in the 
                writing community for a handful of years, practicing and reading poetry until this very day. Tony mostly writes 
                love poems, having discovered his affinity for the genre after reading Pablo Neruda’s “Love Sonnet XVII”.</p>
